//print the following:
//percentage buffs for each buliding type (raw synergy)
//production by that building type
//total cookies buffed by grandmas for that building type
//cookies added per grandma for that building type

//idea for synergy data gathering: use the tooltip function of each the game object (building) to grab the raw html and then extract data from that; better idea: DON'T.


//building for a particular grandma synergy index 'n': Game.Upgrades[Game.GrandmaSynergies[4]].buildingTie


//Grandma synergy upgrades lie in the upgrade ID range of 57-63
//synergy upgrade for a particular building: 55 + building ID
//	-they have a building tie to the building they synergise with
